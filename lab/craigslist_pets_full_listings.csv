Jumping Spider accessories Reduced $5 per set,Barboursville,https://charlottesville.craigslist.org/pet/d/barboursville-jumping-spider/7815965920.html,"QR Code Link to This Post


New! 2 round pretty shiny magnetic hides. One blue one purple. Two pieces of netting with magnets about 4 x 8. One is purple one is green. 4 clear magnetic food water dishes. Cost a fortune with shipping!  Can separate in sets of one hide one net 2 dishes per set.  The purple goes together and the deep blue looks good with the green netting. Due to scammers, tell me what town you live in. Shipping cost me more than $5 for each set and for the dishes separately. Of course they are of no use to you if you don't have a jumping spider.",unknown,5.0

I got Cletus about two years ago, and i’ve tried to be the best owner i can be but i still dont have enough time for him. I’m not actually sure how old he is, my guess is 3-4 years old. He has never bit me or anyone who’s held him! He’s also ran up on my lap a few times, i let him out to play and his favorite thing to do is run through the tunnel.  He’s not out enough to bond with me just enough for exercise. He will come with almost everything he materially needs including : dust, dust bath, hay, food & water equipment, shelter, and chin buddy. The cage is free but it is pretty wacky. It’s two horizontal cages zip tied together with a hole connecting the two. If you don’t have a cage i can wait until you get one. Text or Email for a rehoming fee.",unknown,

SERIOUS INQUIRIES, LOVING DOG OWNERS ONLY - WE WILL VET APPLICANTS

Winston is an incredibly loving and cuddly companion who will melt your heart with his warm, affectionate nature. He’s the type of dog who will happily curl up next to you for a snuggle session or simply bask in your attention. If you’re looking for a dog who loves people and craves human connection, he’s your guy! Warning: Lots of Cuddles Are Required If You Adopt This Dog!!

This sweet boy is fully house-trained. He is also food-motivated, and we have taught him some basic tricks (sit, down, paw, high-five, belly... ). He’s easy to walk with, enjoys short daily walks, and is a 55-pound pup, so we use a harness to make walking a breeze. He’s great on the leash and walks confidently by your side.

Winston has been good with other dogs in the past, we do recommend cautious introductions due to an unfortunate incident where he was bitten two years ago.

We adore Winston and want to find the perfect home for him—a family with time and love to give him the attention he deserves.",unknown,
